/*
Name: Number of Segments in a String
Statement:
Given a string s, return the number of segments in the string. A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence
of non-space characters.
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
Explanation: The five segments are ["Hello,", "my", "name", "is", "John"]

Method 1: Efficient(Two pointers)
1. Use two pointers, first pointer will scan one character one by one until it get space.
2. Second pointer will point first character of current window
3. If first pointer read space, just increase the count if first > second and move second pointer one location ahead to
   first pointer.

Implementation:
class Solution {
public:
    int countSegments(string s)
    {
       s += ' ';
       int j = 0, answer = 0;
       for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)
       {
            if(s[i] == ' ')
            {
                if(i != j)
                    answer += 1;
                j = i + 1;
            }
       }

       return answer;
    }
};
