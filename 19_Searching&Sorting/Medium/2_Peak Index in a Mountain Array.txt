/*
Name: Peak Index in a Mountain Array(Element which is greater)
Statement:
[No Need]

Example:
Input: arr = [8,9,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 1

Example:
Input: arr = [2,5,6,7,8,1,3]
Output: 4

1. Method: Binary Search
    1. Just check next element to middle.
Note:
1. If you are returning an answer in above only(not at end), then you can set high to mid - 1 as we have all-ready checked answer with middle.
2. But, if you are returning an answer at the end then you have to set high to mid as middle one not checked and making mid -1 will leads to missing check with middle element.
3. Try to return answer at end only as you don't need to worry about edge conditions.

// Solution:
int peakIndexInMountainArray(vector<int>& arr)
{
	int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

	while(low < high)
	{
		int mid = (low + high) / 2;

		if(arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1])
			low = mid + 1;
		else
			high = mid;
	}

	return low;
}
