/*
Name: Reshape the Matrix.
Problem Statement:
In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different
size r x c keeping its original data.
You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of
the wanted re-shaped matrix.
The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as
they were.
If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output
the original matrix.
Example 1:
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]], r = 1, c = 4
Output: [[1,2,3,4]]
