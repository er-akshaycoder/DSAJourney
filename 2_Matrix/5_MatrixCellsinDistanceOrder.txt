/*
Name: Matrix Cells in Distance Order
Problem Statement:
You are given four integers row, cols, rCenter, and cCenter. There is a rows x cols matrix and you are on the cell with
the coordinates (rCenter, cCenter).
Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (rCenter, cCenter) from the smallest
distance to the largest distance. You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.
The distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.

Example 1:
Input: rows = 1, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (0, 0) to other cells are: [0,1]

Method 1:
1. Create an array of size r * c with pair row and columns.
2. Insert all elements' pair into array and sort the array by taking sum of its pair.
3. Output the array.

Method 2:
1. Create an array of size r * c.
2. Stat from given (rCenter, cCenter) as first level and insert it into array.
3. Increase the level by 1 and check with all surrounded elements if they are valid and insert it into the array.
4. Go for next level and do same process.
