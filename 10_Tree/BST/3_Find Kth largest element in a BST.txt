Title: Kth largest element in BST
Statement:
Given a Binary search tree. Your task is to complete the function which will return the Kth largest element without
doing any modification in Binary Search Tree.

Example: Take any random example

1. Method: Recursion
    1. As largest element is needed, we have to explore right subtree first.
    2. Go to right subtree
    3. Decrease k for rightmost node
    4. Check if k becomes 0, if yes and print answer
    5. Go to left Subtree.

*/
// Solution:
void findKthNode(Node *root, int &k, int &answer)
{
    if(!root)       return;

    findKthNode(root -> right, k, answer);

    k = k - 1;

    if(k == 0)
        answer = root -> data;

    findKthNode(root -> left, k, answer);
}
