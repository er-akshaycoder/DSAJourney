/*
Name: Delete without head pointer
Statement:
You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes. The task is to
delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given.
Note: No head reference is given to you. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the linked
list.
Example:
Input:
N = 4
value[] = {10,20,4,30}
node = 20
Output: 10 4 30
Explanation: After deleting 20 from
the linked list, we have remaining
nodes as 10, 4 and 30.

Method 1: Shifting data
1. Copy data of next node of given node into given node.
2. Copy next of next node of given node into given node to deference next node from list.

*/
// Implementation:
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
    void deleteNode(Node *del)
    {
       del -> data = del -> next -> data;
       del -> next = del -> next -> next;

    }
};
