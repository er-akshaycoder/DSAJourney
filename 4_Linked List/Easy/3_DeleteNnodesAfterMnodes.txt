/*
Name: Delete N nodes after M nodes
Statement: Given a linked list, delete N nodes after skipping M nodes of a linked list until the last of the linked
list.
Example:
Input:
M N
2 1
9 1 3 5 9 4 10 1
Output: 9 1 5 9 10 1

Method 1: Naive
1. Start scanning list and maintain previous pointer, when node counter reaches to M do following:
2. Skip further N nodes and assign (N + 1)th node to next of previous node.

//Implementation:
class Solution
{
    public:
    void linkdelete(struct Node  *head, int M, int N)
    {
        struct Node  *temp, *prev;
        int i = 0;
        temp = head;

        while(temp)
        {
            if(i == M)
            {
                int j = N;
                while(temp && j--)
                    temp = temp -> next;

                prev -> next = temp;
                if(temp == NULL)
                    break;
                i = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                i += 1;
                prev = temp;
                temp = temp -> next;
            }

        }
    }
